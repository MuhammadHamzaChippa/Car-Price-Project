# Car Price Project

## Abstract
This project predict the price of the car against the attributes of car using scikit-learn library of Python

## Algorithm Implemented 
The following algorithms are implemented on the dataset.
<ul>
	<li>Linear Regression with RMSE of 2857.69</li>
	<li>Decision Tree Regression with RMSE of 2816.229</li>
	<li>Random Forest Regressor with RMSE of 2221.33</li>
	<li>SVR with RMSE of 2221.33</li>
</ul>

Random Forest Regressor and SVR works better than the rest of the model after Fine tuning the model usinf Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV 
<ul>
	<li>RMSE of Random Forest Regressor was 1700.82</li>
	<li>RMSE of SVR was 3478.193</li>
</ul>

## Best Model 
Random Forest Regressor is the best working model on the given dataset with the RMSE OF 1700.82
